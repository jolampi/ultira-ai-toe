# Week 1

A good amount of time was spend on thinking the project idea. After indirectly getting this idea from the list of example assignments I did some prototyping before finally deciding on it. No code has been submitted yet but setting the basic game up shouldn't take too much time and will be up next. After that I can get into the actual 

I had an intuition that the time taken by simple minmax algorithms would be too much and some browsing seemed to support this though. This way I quickly found out the Monte Carlo approach that also seemed much more interesting and supportive of this course's themes. I'm still not completely sure how I will implement the system in practice because I will probably need to juggle between few different presentations of arbitrary game situations for the best possible efficiency.

Time spent this week (rough estimate): 9 hours.


# Week 2

The proximity of the second deadline has resulted into not not reaching all the milestones this week. The main focus was presenting the status of a game to user.
